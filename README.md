# Portfolio
![Morris Buel](profile.jpg) 

My personal portfolio, of what I've worked on and what currently working on. It also will contain my personal statement of faith - as my faith will be revealed by my work. I enjoy learning, and applying the knowledge I have acquired to solve problems. The greatest gift we can give others is mercy, love and forgiveness.

Shalom.

## Java Projects

The Java Projects I've worked on will be linked to and described in this section. (TBC)

## JavaScript Projects

### [Guess my Number Game](./JavaScript/guess-my-number/index.html)

Simple one player game that has the player guess a number between 1 and 20. Modified from course work, by using a "game" class object to keep track of and control game logic. Also added saving of high score to local storage, so the game will remember your score between sessions.

### [Pig Game](./JavaScript/pig-game/index.html)

Simple two player game with a dice roll. First player to score 100 points wins. As with the prior game, modified from course work to use a "Game logic" class to control and keep track of everything. Also modified the dice "roll" class to have a rolling animation.

### [Snake Game](./JavaScript/snake-game/index.html)

First project in JavaScript, simple snake game. Might revisit this with my new knowledge and improve the logic, score tracking.

### [Stop Watch](./JavaScript/stopwatch/index.html)

Next project, a personal one. Want to make a clone of a watch, with time tracking and stop watch features.

### [Personal Bible Studies](https://mbuel.github.io/BibleStudy/)

Personal space, where I capture my thoughts on the Bible, on religion and what we must do to be saved. 

## React Projects

### [Ten Commandments](./JavaScript/React/ten-commandments)

Modified from Pet Project, goal is to demonstrate the danger of removing one jot or tittle from the law.

### Pet Appointment tracking

Simple application to track pet appointments and add new appointments

### My Blog
